      <description>Recently I had to start different type of Hadoop Hdfs clusters in my local environment, such as HA, router based federation, federation, etc.
Hadoop is not designed to run in containers but with very low effort it works very well. For example a non-HA cluster could be started easily as the datanode will try to connect to the namenode again and again until the namenode is started.
There is just one precondition: the namenode directory should be formatted, but it could be handled by a custom launcher script which includes the required steps.</description>
